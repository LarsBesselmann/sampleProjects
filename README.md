# How to demo Modernized Runtime Extension for Java End-to-End - DRAFT

The following guide should help to do a simple end-to-end demo.
Main steps:
1. Demonstrate the application in traditional WAS
2. Analyze the application using Application Modernization Accelerator (AMA) to identify issues when migrating to Liberty
3. Fix modernization issues using the Application Modernization Accelerator Development Tools
4. Create a Liberty cluster in MoRE and deploy the application

It is based on the MoRE TechZone environment:
https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/mo-re--ama-demos-and-environment-2q25-release


## Introduction

MoRE provides the capability to continue using traditional WebSphere Application Server (tWAS) Operational Model to manage Java 17 and Java 8 applications within the same traditional WebSphere administrative environment.

<kbd>![](./images/media/MoRE_Diagram.png)</kbd>

In this demo, you will show how to extend a WebSphere ND Cell, using the MoRE feature pak, for managed Liberty servers to manage and run Java 17 / Jakarta EE 10 (subset) applications using the familiar WebSphere administrative mode and admin console.

The demo first shows an example application “Mod  Resorts” running in WebSphere ND 9.0.23. The application is a simple Java 8 application using JEE 7 APIs. 

Included with the demo, is a new version of the Mod Reports application that is built using Java 17 and Jakarta 10 EE APIs, which are supported in the managed Liberty Servers (MoRE).  




## Preparation:


### Prepare and build the maven project

1. Create a working directory and download the project

		mkdir -p ~/Student/labs
		git clone https://github.com/LarsBesselmann/sampleProjects.git ~/Student/labs

2. Switch to the directory WhereAmI_MoRE_Demo and uzip the initial project

		cd ~/Student/labs/WhereAmI_MoRE_Demo
		unzip WhereAmI-2.0.0-Project.zip

3. Switch to the WhereAmI directory 

		cd WhereAmI

4. As the modresorts project depends on was_public.jar, you must make it visible to maven to avoid build failures. Run the following command 

   	    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./was_dependency/was_public.jar -DpomFile=./was_dependency/was_public-9.0.0.pom

    You should see a success message.

5. Build the application with maven

		mvn clean
		mvn package

	The generated war file is: target/WhereAmI-2.0.0.war


### Prepare the MoRE cell and deploy the application

1. Start the Dmgr and the two Node agents

		~/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/bin/startManager.sh 
		~/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin/startNode.sh
		~/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv02/bin/startNode.sh

2. Create a tWAS cluster called tWASCluster1 and two members (tWASMember1, tWASMember2), one on each node.

		~/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/bin/wsadmin.sh -lang jython -user techzone -password IBMDem0s! -f ~/Student/labs/WhereAmI_MoRE_Demo/setupScripts/tWASCluster_create.py 

3. Install the generated application war to the tWAS cluster. During installation, adjust the context root to **/tWAS**.


		~/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/bin/wsadmin.sh -lang jython -user techzone -password IBMDem0s! -f ~/Student/labs/WhereAmI_MoRE_Demo/setupScripts/tWASCluster_WhereAmI_install.py 


4. 	Access via browser the WebSphere Admin Console via URL: https://localhost:9043/ibm/console, User ID: techzone, password: **IBMDem0s!**

5. Enable the command assistance <br>
From the Admin Console, set the console preferences to enable command assistance and log command assistance. This will allow to see the wsadmin commands for UI driven tasks.

	a. Navigation: System administration > Console preferences

	b. Select the following options:

			Enable command assistance notifications
			Log command assistance commands


6. Start the cluster tWASCluster1


		~/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/bin/wsadmin.sh -lang jython -user techzone -password IBMDem0s! -f ~/Student/labs/WhereAmI_MoRE_Demo/setupScripts/tWASCluster_start.py 

7. Verify that the application has been started.

### Prepare AMA

1. Start AMA

		cd ~/application-modernization-accelerator-local-4.3.0/
		scripts/startLocal.sh 

2. Open a browser and access AMA via the URL https://rhel9-base.gym.lan:3001

3. In AMA, create a workspace named **MoRE_Demo**

4. Run the data collector to create a data collection and upload it

	1. Download the data collector (tar -zxvf DiscoveryTool-Linux_MoRE_Demo.tgz )

	2. run the data collector against the MoRE cell via command

		transformationadvisor-4.3.0/bin/transformationadvisor -w /home/techzone/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/

	3. Wait until the collection has been uploaded and is available in AMA


5. Show in the **Visualization** tab that there are no dependencies to other applications

	<kbd>![](./images/media/AMA_Visualization.png)</kbd>

6. Switch to the **Assessment** tab that the application can be migrated to MoRE but has some issues that must be fixed.
